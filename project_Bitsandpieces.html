        repairs on consumer electronics products that otherwise would be replaced. multiple repairs were attempted and
        common problems between theses repairs were identified.

        After the personal repair attempts I found a lot of common problems beteen devices. So the next step was to find
        out if these problems are commonly experienced. In literary research I found there were many workshops held in
        which users attempted repairs and common problems were put into a repair barriers and motvations (Terzioğlu, N.
        (2021)).

        After the ideation sketches an interesting future was envisioned. A future in which companies would sell modules
        and parts and products can be created out of these modules. Or bought together. Making functional parts into
        seperate modules could result in the current drive for companies moving from creating a slightly upgraded
        product every year to actually improving modules seperately. Plus reaulting in a need for companies to have
        universal standards to connect their product modules. Blender renders were created by showing this future
        with a possible BOSE speaker module and a framework laptops cartridge which could also be used to deal with
        various interfaces needed to interact with the device

        At the beginning of the project, I set goals to achieve during my final bachelor project. At first, I wanted to
        implement a lot of my main expertise area development that I like to work on the most intrinsically. Since these
        abilities are the ones I want to work on specializing in the future. However, I also wanted to apply some new
        techniques that I did not fully apply to projects yet. Mainly the use of literary research that isn't an
        afterthought. Also, the business perspective of the topic is one I wanted to explore more than in previous
        projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the big goals that I could finally apply was related to the user and society expertise area. During my
        education at industrial design I have always felt that the way literary research was done, was not the way I
        envision it. Sometimes it felt more like shopping for references than really reading the research and weighing
        it. So I set the goal to do this differently. I was aiming at doing this by first learning with personal
        experience and then seeing if there is research that fit my personal experience with repairs. If the personal
        research did not meet up with the literary research the next step would be to do a user test.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another goal I had was to work on a personally preferred project goal. Working on a project case given by the
        squads is a good way to develop skills but it makes it way harder to apply vision or personal values and
        beliefs. Additionally, it makes it harder for me to be motivated for a project. So I set the goal to make sure I
        could participate in a project Where I determined the case in discussion with coaches. I planned on doing this
        by getting a handshake with a coach for my project topic.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another goal I had at the beginning of the project is to learn more about the application of electronics in
        design. Up until now the realization of electronics was still on the level of breadboard prototyping without the
        need to really adapt designs to the limitations electronics bring. In terms of business and entrepreneurship,
        the goal I set for the project was to try and start a business out of the final bachelor project. Since the
        topic is one I really believe in. However, in what form this could be possible I did not know yet at the start
        of the project.
        <br />
        <br />
        The first goal I achieved was getting my topic approved for my final bachelor project. And at the first part of
        the project, the personal research in combination with literary research was a great way to start achieving my
        goals when it comes to literary research. The personal research I did match up with the literary research I was
        able to find on repair.
        <br />
        <br />
        When it comes to applying electronics in design further than a breakout board and considering the limitation
        that there are with design for electronics I feel some of this goal was achieved. The part about considering the
        limitations for design for electronics was definitely achieved. During prototyping, I never took an easy out
        when it came to increasing the size of the design to a point where it could not represent the intended product
        anymore.
        <br />
        <br />
        Looking back on the project I would like to have done more when it comes to users and society. At the end of the
        project, I was rushing to finish my final product. I feel I could have focused more on getting feedback from the
        possible user group to get more perspective on the viability of the product and system from a business
        perspective. I would have liked to have done more when considering the business perspective of the idea. The
        angle I am taking now makes sense. Reflecting on the project I think the bigger impact is by making companies
        see that the design system I propose is a great step towards a fairer consumer-company relationship.
        <br />
        <br />
        About applying all my expertise when it comes to turning an idea into reality: with ideation, low-fidelity
        prototyping, high-fidelity prototyping, and applying maker abilities. I was able to create a lot of concepts and
        prototypes. Resulting in a prototype-driven design process. I do feel that the way I presented ideas and what
        ideas I presented could have been better throughout the project.
