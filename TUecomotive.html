                        TUecomotive is a student team focused on creating sustainable solutions in the automotive
                        industry. My role in the team in the seventh team of TUecomotive was a design engineering role
                        as well as a design role. A big task I had in the team was to design the monocoque chassis along
                        with the mechanical team. Working with such strict constraints and deadlines was a completely
                        new experience for me and learned me a lot about the reality of creating something that needs to
                        be structurally sufficient as well as meet all the constraints of the other components that need
                        to meet up with the chassis as well. In my role in the design team, I was mainly responsible for
                        designing the interior panels of the doors and doorhandles as well as a shared role of
                        determining the overall design language of the car.

                    Being part of a student team was a completely different experience than the other projects I was
                    used to at industrial design. Being part of the design team inside a multidisciplinary team learned
                    me a lot about the reality of projects and working inside a big project team. Especially when you
                    have strict deadlines and a very bgi
                    challenge.

                    designing the monocoque chassis for TUecomotive along with the mechanical team showed me a side of
                    an engineering project I would normally be not involved in as designer. Having to design with
                    constraints in terms of material properties in combination with structural strength and taking loads
                    into account was part of my interdisciplinary development at TUecomotive. Not only did it teach me
                    hard skills likeadvanced CAD modeling but also a lot of experience in terms of cooperation within
                    interdisciplinary teams.
