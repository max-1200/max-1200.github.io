                        TUecomotive is a student team focussed on creating sustainable solutions in the area of
                        mobility. My role in the team in the seventh team of TUecomotive was a design engineering role
                        as well as an industrial design role. A big task I had in the team was to design the monocoque
                        chassis along with the mechanical team.

                    Being part of a student team was a completely different experience than the other projects I was
                    used to at industrial design. Being part of the design team inside a multidisciplinary team learned
                    me a lot about the reality of projects and working inside a big project team. Especially when you
                    have strict deadlines and a very bgi
                    challenge.

                    designing the monocoque chassis for TUecomotive along with the mechanical team showed me a side of
                    an
                    engineering project I would normally be not involved in as designer. Having to design with
                    constraints in terms
                    of material properties in combination with structural strength and taking loads into account was
                    part of my
                    interdisciplinary development at ecomotive. Not only did it teach me hard skills like advanced CAD
                    modeling but
                    also a lot of experience in terms of cooperation within interdisciplinary teams.
