        designing the monocoque chassis for TUecomotive along with the mechanical team showed me a side of an
        engineering project I would normally be not involved in as designer. Having to design with constraints in terms
        of material properties in combination with structural strength and taking loads into account was part of my
        interdisciplinary development at ecomotive. Not only did it teach me hard skills like advanced CAD modeling but
        also a lot of experience in terms of cooperation within interdisciplinary teams.

        As a design role I mainly focuss on the interior design of the car. Currently I am working on the design of the
        inner door panel of the car and the door handle. Applying the experience in CAD modeling I gained by designing
        the monocoque.

        During my journey at TUecomotive I also gained a lot of experience int the area of exploratory sketching and
        rendered drawing. First by ideating on the exterior of the car, mainly the front of the car. The early grill
        design and the lighting shape. Later in the project my focus has been more on the interior design.
