        designing the monocoque chassis for TUecomotive along with the mechanical team showed me a side of an
        engineering project I would normally be not involved in as designer. Having to design with constraints in terms
        of material properties in combination with structural strength and taking loads into account was part of my
        interdisciplinary development at ecomotive. Not only did it teach me hard skills like advanced CAD modeling but
        also a lot of experience in terms of cooperation within interdisciplinary teams.

        As a design role I mainly focussed on the interior design of the car. I worked on the design of the
        inner door panel of the car and the door handle. Applying the experience in CAD modeling I gained by designing
        the monocoque.

        During my journey at TUecomotive I also gained a lot of experience int the area of exploratory sketching and
        rendered drawing. First by ideating on the exterior of the car, mainly the front of the car. The early grill
        design and the lighting shape. Later in the project my focus has been more on the interior design.

        Reflecting on the goals I set before the internship there was a lot of flexibility within the team to adapt some
        of these goals to fit my changing interests within the team. The main change I made was choosing to develop my
        mechanical side since this part was completely new to me outside of solid body modeling. Looking back I feel
        this was the right choice to make.
        The main area I learned more about than expected is the Business and entrepreneurship side of the project. Even
        though I was not part of the External Relations team within TU/ecomotive, the various meetings with sponsors and
        general team meetings with the various sub-teams have learned me a lot about how it is to work towards a
        tangible goal that actually needs to be produced with a group of people who are making it happen.
        Working with multiple teams within a project is something that you donâ€™t experience during industrial design
        projects. This knowledge is something that will be vital when either functioning in a company but also when
        starting a company.
        <br />
        <br />
        On the creativity and aesthetics side of the project I have completely changed the way I think about
        conceptualizing ideas and how to present them, learning new methods of exploratory sketching, blender,
        photoshop, cardboard modeling, and styrodur modeling I feel more equipped to convey ideas in the right situation
        than before my internship.
        <br />
        <br />
        Developing myself on the technology and realization and user and social side of the project, the material
        research and sustainability discussions shaped my vision of sustainable design in terms of designing
        environmentally friendly products. Reflecting on the conclusions of these discussions I think that what really
        matters, in the end, is the amount of fossil fuel used to create your product. On the other hand on the part of
        design what matters the most is that you design a product that can be fully recycled and turned into a new
        product. However, I feel that modularity and durability, repairability and modularity of products go a long way
        to creating a sustainable product from the perspective of a customer.
