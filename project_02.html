                        Project 2 was a project with a consulting mindset. Weekboek is the result of this project in
                        cooperation with SWZ care center. This care center mainly took care of people with acquired
                        brain injury at the time. During interviews conducted with the caregivers, but also two of the
                        clients of SWZ care center The problem to solve was defined. The result of these interviews and
                        many ideation sessions was Weekboek. A tangible day planner that would be used by people in the
                        care center to keep track of their day and stay in touch with the care center even when at home.
                        The idea evolved from the problems people with acquired brain injury experience with keeping the
                        structure in their day. In this project, the focus lay more on exploring expertise areas which I
                        had less experience with before this project. These expertise areas are user and society and
                        business and entrepreneurship.
