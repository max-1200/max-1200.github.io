        Weekboek is the result of a project in cooperation with SWZ care center. This care center mainly took care of
        people with acquired brain injury at the time. During interviews held with the caregivers, but also two of the
        clients of SWZ carecenter. The result of these interviews and many ideation sessions was Weekboek. A tangible
        dayplanner which can be used by people in the carecenter to keep track of their day and stay in touch with the
        carecenter even when at home. The idea evolved from the problems people with acquired brain injury experience
        with keeping the structure in their day.
        In this project the focus lay more on exploring expertise areas which I had less experience with before this
        project. These expertise areas being user and society and business and entrepreneurship.

        In this project, the focus lay more on exploring expertise areas which I had less experience with before this
        project. These expertise areas are user and society and business and entrepreneurship. So I decided to be more
        involved with the interview process of the clients and less involved with the realization of the product we were
        envisioning. After this, I also explored the feasibility, viability, and desirability of the concept of Weekboek
        and its implementation.
        <br />
        <br />
        After the project finished is where I learned a lot more about projects. Because this was the part that was new
        for me and all of my teammates. Working outside of the comfort of a project with a set deadline to finish a
        project. The roles were re-evaluated and I decided that I wanted to be more involved with the realization part
        of the project. Because I missed it when I decided to focus more on the other expertise areas. So I felt I had
        more to learn again on the other expertise areas. After this re-evaluation of roles, I grew in my abilities of
        prototyping with electronics and the application of math in programming.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even though the continuation of this project was very useful in terms of technology and realization and math
        data and computing, the invaluable knowledge actually was in the area of business and entrepreneurship. The
        invaluable knowledge was how hard it is to keep contact with the client going and to make sure goals are still
        aligned and to make sure everyone is still on the same page when it comes to a project. Because after trying to
        finish the project before the holiday the motivation of everyone in the group started to die off a little but we
        almost had the functional prototype which could be tested and ready for a user test. Not only this on the side
        of SWZ the communication became limited and eventually died off, unfortunately. The exact reason for this is
        still not completely clear. However, it dis teach me the importance of having a client be on board with how a
        project is going.
