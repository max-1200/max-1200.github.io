            Project 2 started with an open-ended design case with a client called SWZ Zorg, a daycare activity center
            for people with acquired brain injury. After research into the topic, the ideation process began. Before the
            ideation process, the goal I had for the creative process was to successfully communicate creative ideas
            with sketches. Communicating this to the team members was successful but I always felt that my sketches were
            not professional enough to convince clients of ideas. This is also why blender was used to create realistic
            representations of the concept. Looking beyond personal development from the creative process I feel like
            there was too much time spent on coming up with the concept idea. While the idea of having an electronic
            planner device called Weekboek was the result of this long process, a planner was already talked about early
            in the ideation process. What I learned from this is that ideation sessions should be met with prototyping,
            feedback and reflection to give them meaning.

            After project 2 ended the client felt that the concept was something worth further developing and even
            spending some money on. This opened up a great opportunity for us as a team to continue developing ourselves
            with this continuation. For me, this meant that I wanted to continue on the technological side of
            prototyping. This meant determining the parts of Weekboek that were essential for the user and making those
            parts work. Like a flip of physical pages should change the day on the planner app displayed on a tablet.
            creating a tangible experience.

            First, communication between tablet and electonics was attempted with the USB on-the-go protocol but after
            hitting a lot of bumps with the combination of charging and serial communication, wireless communication was
            explored. This is why Bluetooth was chosen. First I and another teammate tried to make this possible with
            Bluetooth low energy, although learning about the Bluetooth low energy protocol was useful for my
            understanding of wireless communication. It resulted in too many issues making it communicate with the app
            that was being developed with another team member. This is why regular Bluetooth was chosen to establish
            communication with the tablet. Because of a lack of knowledge of how serial communication actually worked
            this did not work immediately and led to having to find out how it exactly worked. Here I got a deeper
            understanding of how serial communication works on the level of baud rates and how this translated into the
            actual bits being sent through the Bluetooth module. After gaining this knowledge the problem was solved on
            the technological and programming part, which also meant my development was over on that part. Additionally,
            I also learned important soldering techniques and in general got a better understanding of electronic
            theory. Also, a better understanding of using open source software came along with learning about the
            Bluetooth protocol and trying to find the right libraries online.
