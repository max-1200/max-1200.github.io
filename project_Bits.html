        Project bits is a project that explores the possibility of creating consumer electronics products that
        are
        easily repairable and last a long time without comprimising on the performance of products.

        At the beginning of the project I immersed myself into the persepctive of the user. This was done by attempting
        repairs on consumer electronics products that otherwise would be replaced. multiple repairs were attempted and
        common problems between theses repairs were identified.

        After the ideation sketches an interesting future was envisioned. A future in which companies would sell modules
        and parts and products can be created out of these modules. Or bought together. Making functional parts into
        seperate modules could result in the current drive for companies moving from creating a slightly upgraded
        product every year to actually improving modules seperately. Plus reaulting in a need for companies to have
        universal standards to connect their product modules. Blender renders were created by showing this future
        with a possible BOSE speaker module and a framework laptops cartridge which could also be used to deal with
        various interfaces needed to interact with the device
