                        Project 3 was a design research project with an explorative mindset toward the future of
                        mobility. During this project, we researched ways of creating shape-shifting materials in the
                        context of the automotive industry. The reason for this research direction is the basis from
                        which we started exploring. Which was market research. During research into groundbreaking new
                        developments in the automotive industry. A future perspective was considered, to find out how to
                        create shape-shifting materials that could more clearly indicate the intention of autonomous
                        omnidirectional vehicles like those proposed by the new company called Zoox. instead of just
                        using light color to indicate a change in direction. We proposed to make the car shift shape to
                        more clearly indicate a change in direction. To show the possibility of parts of the car, like
                        lights and bumper units changing shape, origami was posed as a possible solution.

                    After defining the concept of a shape shifting vehicle and exploring origami and other options as a

                    be producable.
