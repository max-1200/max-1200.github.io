                        Project 3 was a design research project with an explorative mindset. Looking into ways of creating shape shifting materials in the context of the automotive industry, a creative
                        exploration was considered to find out how to create shape shifting materials that could even more clearly
                        indicate the intention of autonomous omnidirectional vehicles.
