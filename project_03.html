        future omnidirectional autonimous vehicle communication with other road users

        Imagining a future in which there are omnidirectional vehciles that are also autonomous along with human
        controlled vehicles and other road users. Communicating the intention of a vehicle will be an important
        development of these future vehciles. During project 3 the idea was explored to use origami to change the shape
        of the lighting fixtures but also other parts of the car to indicate direction.
