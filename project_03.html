        Looking into ways of creating shape shifting materials in the context of the automotive industry, a creative
        exploration was considered to find out how to create shape shifting materials that could even more clearly
        indicate the intention of autonomous omnidirectional vehicles.

        Imagining a future in which there are omnidirectional vehciles that are also autonomous along with human
        controlled vehicles and other road users. Communicating the intention of a vehicle will be an important
        development of these future vehciles. During project 3 the idea was explored to use origami to change the shape
        of the lighting fixtures but also other parts of the car to indicate direction.

        Considering creativity and aesthetics I got inspired by origami. The thing I could not stop thinking about is
        the patterns and how you can create them. So I started doing it, instead of delaying it. During somewhat the
        same time we came to the concept of multi-purpose vehicles and shape change in project 3. This was an ideal
        concept to start exploring origami too as a team. From this creative exploration, I learned a lot about what
        patterns there are how to make aesthetics that made sense considering shapeshift and afterwards considering
        direction in a vehicle. Skills in the creative area I also developed are filming prototypes and editing them in
        adobe premiere pro. As time progresses I begin to see the need to be good at this. Which is also a new PDP goal.
        Skills I applied were sketching and using adobe illustrator to successfully communicate ideas.
        After this creative exploration, we really got to think about how to recreate these origami patterns in the
        context of a vehicle and we looked at other examples of engineering applications of origami. I thought about
        methods and material options to recreate it. This is where I developed myself in the area of technology and
        realization. After finding other designs that could be taken as inspiration I started the process of creating
        the CAD models and the 3d printing, which was a goal I had at the end of project 2. Doing the material research
        I really got better at understanding the method of 3d printing and its limits as well as for the materials
        available. A new PDP goal is to learn more about other production methods too. Other technology and realization
        development goals that I had were achieved by working on the continuation of project 2, where prototyping an
        electronic system with sensors, microcontrollers, Bluetooth connection to a tablet was all developed by me and
        another team member.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the end of the project, I also decided to work also on the other side of the project of user research.
        Creating the questions for the semi-structured user interview was quite hard because of the variety of things we
        could ask and was a great learning point because of this. Looking at the results of the interview we received
        the information that we needed. Conducting the interviews confirmed what I knew before. I do not enjoy it that
        much. But I know itâ€™s an essential part of designing. Certainly because this project is a research design
        project. The other two expertise areas are not the expertise areas I focussed on during this project 3.
