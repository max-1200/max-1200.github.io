                This is the explination and download page to my DIY version of the Ikea Skadis peg board.

            <div class="text_style_large_ea" style="float: left; position:relative; margin-top: 3%">
                The top image shows the full assmebly of the skadiskaduskala. To produce the the skadis board yourself
                you will need 4mm MDF (5mm would be ideal but it's not commonly available). I took the closest thickness
                I could get to the real thing so I can buy the ikea modules or 3d print modules from thingyverse for
                this system. It's good to mention that some of them will have a somewhat loose fit, which I don't mind.
                The plate needs to be 80cm x 60cm to lasercut my file. If you want to adapt these dimensions of the board
                file to your liking you can edit the solidworks file I added. Or search online for the spacing between
                the holes for the ikea board so you can make it yourself too. On the image you can see the way I attach
                the board to the wall as a full assembly.
                <br />
                <br />
                The next image shows the rectangular wall mount block I designed to create space between the wall and
                the board. For aesthetic reasons and to make sure the modules from ikea and the thingyverse fit. these
                blocks can be 3d printed with PLA or a material of your liking. The top hole is meant to fit a specific
                metal M4 insert that I will link to in the parts list. You can also adapt this file to your liking If
                you want to try to 3D print threading or want another insert size. Although I suggest to just get the M4
                inserts. The editable body is in the same part file as the Skadis board. The metal insert is easy to
                melt into the PLA with a soldering iron with a round tip. The bottom slit is there for the screw that
                goes into the plug and the wall. I used quite a small screw and there was little margin for a bigger
                one. So be careful you have the right screw. The slot has space for a screw head diameter of 8mm. It's a
                slot so there is a possibility to adjust if the drilling wasn't completely straight. However I haven't
                used this feature since the drilling was spot on so be careful not to completely rely on that feature.
                <br />
                <br />
                The last image shows the bottom spacer which will not need to be attached to the wall but just to the
                bottom of the board so it hangs parallel to the wall. Here I also used the same M4 insert.
