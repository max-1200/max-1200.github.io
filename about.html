                    I am an all-round industrial designer that likes to work on turning ideas into reality. With a
                    focus
                    on
                    innovative, inspiring, and sustainable concepts.

                    My name is Max Crutzen, personally and professionally I would describe myself as a doer and a
                    curious
                    person. From when I was small I have always liked a wide variety of topics. From history to
                    economy,
                    art, drawing, fixing and creating. A big character trait is that I don’t like discussing
                    something over
                    and over when trying something out is just a few steps away. This is also why designing through
                    prototyping is one of the parts of the design process I enjoy the most. I do not consider myself
                    a
                    leader. However, I will definitely not work in the background either. When I believe in a goal
                    of a
                    project I throw my heart into it. Knowing the ins and outs of it and throwing all my skills at
                    it to
                    make it happen.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As partially mentioned before what I enjoy the most in a design process is the realization of an
                    idea.
                    It’s the part of a project in which I feel like my personal values are also the easiest to way
                    in the
                    design process. Applying fair design for the user, making products environmentally friendly, and
                    making
                    sure no unnecessary waste is created is very much in your hands when you make decisions about
                    materials,
                    aesthetics, CAD designs for the parts, the bill of materials, and production method. I feel this
                    is the
                    point in the process where you have a lot of influence on the way your product is going to turn
                    out.
                    This is the main reason I enjoy this outside of being intrinsically motivated by creating.
                    What I mean by the realization of an idea is the process from the conceptualization with the
                    early quick
                    and dirty sketches and prototypes to the final product which is production ready. This identity
                    was
                    confirmed for me as my role within TU/ecomotive. All the ideas for the car with zero emissions
                    during
                    its lifetime would not have been possible if the right decisions were not made when it comes to
                    the
                    design process and production choices of the car.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    My areas of interest grew a lot during my bachelor's. My interests at first were in the area of
                    product
                    design and city design. But this quickly grew with an interest to design for clients with
                    specific
                    cases, but also a lot towards the topic of mobility. Design for repairability and extended
                    lifetime of
                    products became a strong interest for me. Since it fits my values of sustainable design from a
                    societal
                    and environmental point of view.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    When it comes to hard skills I feel that my ability to get an idea on paper that looks realistic
                    and
                    real is a real asset. I also have experience with other methods of rendered concept making like
                    blender
                    or photoshop. Outside of that, I can also work with CAD modeling very well. Both solid body and
                    surface
                    body modeling. For the production of these CAD models, I have a lot of experience with 3d
                    printing, both
                    FDM and SLA printing. Additionally, I also have experience with laser cutting. I developed these
                    skills
                    with my work at TU/e innovation space where I work as a service desk assistant. Outside of these
                    maker
                    skills, this job also teaches me a lot about quick problem-solving skills. Students come by with
                    unique
                    problems all the time. Having a quick solution ready is something that I learned quickly as a
                    service
                    desk assistant.

                    I believe in a bright future for humanity. A future that is socially and environmentally
                    friendly. A
                    future in
                    which companies don't create products just to sell new units. A future in which open-source
                    software
                    and
                    hardware become standard practice in the market. I believe that the only limit to our reality is
                    our
                    imagination
                    and that my role as a designer is to help in this process of turning imagination into reality.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    However, I feel there is a wrong trend in society in which it’s normal practice for companies
                    that
                    take advantage
                    of a system of laws and loopholes to make the largest amount of profit possible when selling
                    products. With
                    tricks like planned obsolescence [1]. While also ignoring the environmental and societal impacts
                    they have.
                    However, I see a present and a future in which new small companies try to change the market from
                    within
                    Companies where people get together on common values and visions. To change the world together.
                    A
                    great example
                    for me is the company Framework laptops [2]. Which is successfully creating repairable and
                    upgradable laptops.
                    I believe that it is my role as a designer to try and make the right choices when it comes to
                    the
                    topics I care
                    about the most. Making fair choices for the user and the environment. My participation in the
                    student team
                    TU/ecomotive is a perfect example of designing for a more environmentally sustainable world.
                    With
                    ZEM we took
                    environmental sustainability into account in all steps of the lifecycle of the car: production,
                    life, and
                    the afterlife of the car. With my Final bachelor project, I tried to tackle the societal
                    sustainability of the way products
                    are designed in the market today. By creating a system in which multiple user levels are
                    considered
                    when taking
                    repair into account as a standard for newly designed products.
