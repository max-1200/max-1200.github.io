                        Project 2 was a design research project with an explorative mindset. Weekboek is the result of
                        this
                        project
                        in cooperation with SWZ care center. This care center mainly took care of people with acquired
                        brain
                        injury at the time. During interviews held with the caregivers, but also two of the clients of
                        SWZ
                        carecenter. The result of these interviews and many ideation sessions was Weekboek. A tangible
                        dayplanner which can be used by people in the carecenter to keep track of their day and stay in
                        touch
                        with the carecenter even when at home. The idea evolved from the problems people with acquired
                        brain
                        injury experience with keeping the structure in their day. In this project the focus lay more on
                        exploring expertise areas which I had less experience with before this project. These expertise
                        areas
                        being user and society and business and entrepreneurship.
