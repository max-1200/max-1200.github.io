                        Project bits is my final bachelor’s project that explores the possibility of creating consumer
                        electronics products that are easily repairable and last a long time without compromising on the
                        performance of products. The goal of the project was to find a solution for the current status
                        quo in the market of consumer electronics in which devices have become more unrepairable due to
                        companies making it almost impossible for anyone to get into the device, get parts, schematics
                        and other design choices.
                        The result of the project is a system of Level repair in which the designer considers the user
                        and which level they can repair at to ensure that all users can on their level, repair their
                        devices. The final prototype shows a cycling computer which implemented this design process by
                        having a separable battery unit and other implementations to make the device more repairable on
                        multiple levels. A product placed inside a market in which repair and standardization have been
                        at the foundation on which the market is built. Which has been changing since the market is also
                        becoming more filled with electronics devices.
