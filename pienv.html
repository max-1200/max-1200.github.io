        Identity

    <div class="big_text_style">
        I am an all round industrial designer that likes to work on turning ideas into reality. With the focus on innovative, inspiring and sustainable concepts.

        My name is Max Crutzen, personally and professionally I would describe myself as a maker. I don’t like
        discussing something when trying something out is just a few steps away. This can be a pro and a con in a design
        process. It’s a pro when you are stuck on a problem and things need to be shaken up. This character trait can
        also be a con when you need to slow down and take a few steps back. Balancing this has been a challenge my whole
        education. I do not consider myself a leader. However, I will definitely not work in the background either. When
        I believe
        in a goal of a project I can really throw my heart into it. Knowing the ins and outs about it and throwing all
        my skills at it to make it happen. I also feel that I am strong at keeping groups together because I can be a
        great at appeasing people in a heated situation.
        <br />
        <br />
        The parts I enjoy the most in a design process is the realization of an idea. It’s the part of a project in
        which I feel like my personal values are also the easiest to way in the design process. Applying fair design for
        the user, making products environmentally friendly and making sure no unnecessary waste is created is very much
        in your hands when you make decisions about materials, CAD designs for the parts and the bill of materials. I
        feel this is the point in the process where you have a lot of influence on the actual way your product is going
        to turn out.
        <br />
        <br />
        What I mean with realization of an idea is the process from the conceptualization with the early quick and dirty
        sketches and prototypes to the final product which is production ready. This identity was really confirmed by my
        role within TU/ecomotive. All the ideas for the car with zero emissions during lifetime would not have been
        possible when the right decisions were not made when it comes to the production of the car.
        My areas of interest grew a lot during my bachelor. My interests at first were in the area of product design and
        city design. But this quickly grew with an interest to design for clients with specific cases, but also a lot
        towards the topic of mobility. Recently web design, design for change of the status qua of lifecycles of
        products and an interest in art also arose.

        Vision
    </div>

    <div class="text_style_large">
        I believe in a bright future for humanity, that the only limit to our reality is our imagination and that I as a
        designer have a possibility to help in this process. But I also see trends happening in the current reality that
        make me afraid and I can’t wait to try and tackle some of them. Companies that take advantage of a system of
        laws and loopholes to make the biggest amount of profit possible. While also ignoring the environmental and
        societal impacts they have. However, I see a present and a future in which new companies try to change the
        market from within. Making things more fair to the user and for the environment.
        During my bachelor I have always tried to keep my personal values into account when picking and participating in
        projects.

        Seeing the unfairness when it comes to the way products are designed, experiencing the indifference people have
        when it comes to societal and political questions, the way technology consumption does not seem to bring us
        further but just gets us addicted and turns us into a datapoint for big companies.
