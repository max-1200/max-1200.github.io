                        A new tech company called Nothing held a competition where they asked their community 
                        to redesign their newly designed phone. The Nothing phone 2a. The competition was focused 
                        on remixing the design. However, I see a bigger opportunity. The company revolves around 
                        the idea of inspiring their users by showing the technology in their products. 
                        This transparency in design can in my opinion go a lot further. How about we let the users 
                        open up their device, empowering them to repair and modify their devices. This project was 
                        a great way to continue working on applying my vision of repairability in consumer products.
