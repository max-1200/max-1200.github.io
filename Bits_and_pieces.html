                        Project bits is my final bachelor’s project that explores the possibility of creating consumer
                        electronics products that are easily repairable and last a long time without compromising on the
                        performance of products. The goal of the project was to find a solution for the current status
                        quo in the market of consumer electronics in which devices have become more unrepairable due to
                        companies making it almost impossible for anyone to get into the device, get parts, schematics
                        and other design choices.
                        The result of the project is a system of Level repair in which the designer considers the user
                        and which level they can repair at to ensure that all users can on their level, repair their
                        devices. The final prototype shows a cycling computer which implemented this design process by
                        having a separable battery unit and other implementations to make the device more repairable on
                        multiple levels. A product placed inside a market in which repair and standardization have been
                        at the foundation on which the market is built. Which has been changing since the market is also
                        becoming more filled with electronics devices.

                    At the beginning of the project, I immersed myself into the experience of the user. This was done by
                    attempting repairs on consumer electronics products that otherwise would be replaced. multiple
                    repairs were attempted and common problems between these repairs were identified.

                    After the personal repair attempts I found a lot of common problems beteen devices. So the next step
                    was to find out if these problems are commonly experienced. In literary research I found there were
                    many workshops held in which users attempted repairs and common problems were put into a repair
                    barriers and motvations (Terzioğlu, N.(2021)).

                    After the ideation sketches an interesting future was envisioned. A future in which companies would
                    sell modules and parts that can be bought separately or bought as an assembled product because of
                    their modularity. Selling functional parts into separate modules could result in the current drive
                    in the market to change. From selling slightly upgraded products to a market in which modules are
                    upgradded. This could also lead to companies having to use universal standards to connect their
                    product modules because the user might like to mix and match. Blender renders were created by
                    showing this future with a possible BOSE speaker module and a framework laptops cartridge which
                    could also be used to deal with various interfaces needed to interact with the device. A glimpse
                    into a future in which companies embrace this approach instead of being afraid to change the current
                    status quo.

                    in the market of consumer electronics.The realization of the final product, a cycling computer was
                    chosen as a prop because it is situated in a market of hobby cyclists in which repair and
                    replacement of parts is already standard practice. The cycling computer has been designed with
                    consideration of the Level repair system that is envisioned to be applied to product design.
