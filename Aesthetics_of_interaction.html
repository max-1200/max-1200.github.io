                        Aesthetics of interaction is a course taught at the University of Eindhoven. Intending to ideate
                        and user test using low-fidelity prototypes to get a better understanding of the interactions
                        the user experiences with a product without having to create a fully functional prototype. The
                        course forces you to rapidly decide the important interactions you want to test and to figure
                        out the minimum realization you need to make to get the answers you need about user interaction.
                        This page shows the result of the final exercise. The idea was to present an alarm clock concept
                        where if you go to sleep, your phone also goes to “bed”. Your phone, like you gets covered. The
                        phone in this aesthetic under this flowerlike clock with 12 leaves which you can use to set the
                        alarm. Until the alarm goes off the cover will stay closed. In the morning, you will wake up by
                        the purring of the motors moving the clock. After this you will gently stroke the clock to open
                        up and wake up your phone.
